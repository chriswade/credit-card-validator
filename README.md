## Getting started
open the terminal and install dependencies

npm i
```

## Running the server

```bash
npm run server
```
 then head to http://localhost:4000/graphql to run queries

## Running queries

```graphql
query {
  GetCard(fullName: "Christopher Wade", cardNumber: 222300004840001, CSV: 444) {
